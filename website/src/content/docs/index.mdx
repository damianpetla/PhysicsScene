PhysicsScene is a Jetpack Compose library that maps existing composables into a Box2D-driven scene.

It is built to deliver physics-based UI effects while preserving your existing layout structure.

PhysicsScene runs on top of Box2D (via `com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-box2d`).

Box2D is created by Erin Catto and licensed under MIT.
