## PhysicsScene

Container that hosts your composables and runs the physics world.
It also emits runtime events via `onEvent`.

## PhysicsSceneState

State holder used to issue commands (`activateBody`, `explode`, `respawnBody`, `applyLinearImpulse`, etc.)
and observe snapshot streams.

## physicsBody modifier

Registers a composable as a body in the scene.

## Effects

Built-in presets such as `FallingShatterEffect` and `CenterBurstEffect`, plus `CustomEffect` for advanced shaping.

## Lifecycle

Bodies move through these lifecycle states:

- `Idle`
- `Falling`
- `Shattering`
- `Removed`

Use `respawnBody(id)` to transition a removed body back to `Idle` without calling `resetScene()`.
