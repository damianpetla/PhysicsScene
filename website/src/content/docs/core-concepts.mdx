This page is kept for older links. The content has been expanded and moved into the new API portal structure.

## New locations

- [PhysicsScene](./api/physics-scene/)
- [Modifier.physicsBody](./api/modifier-physics-body/)
- [PhysicsSceneState](./api/physics-scene-state/)
- [Events, Lifecycle, Snapshots](./api/events-lifecycle-snapshots/)
- [Body and Explosion Specs](./api/body-and-explosion-specs/)

## Quick concept summary

PhysicsScene is still built around three core pieces:

1. `PhysicsScene(...)` as host and fixed-step runtime.
2. `Modifier.physicsBody(...)` as registration contract.
3. `PhysicsSceneState` as command/snapshot control plane.

For full parameter-level detail, use the pages listed above.
