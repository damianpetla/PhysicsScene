## PhysicsScene

Container that hosts your composables and runs the physics world.

## PhysicsSceneState

## physicsBody modifier

Registers a composable as a body in the scene.

## Effects

Built-in presets such as `FallingShatterEffect` and `CenterBurstEffect`, plus `CustomEffect` for advanced shaping.
