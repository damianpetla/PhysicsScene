`PhysicsScene` is the runtime host. It owns the physics world, steps simulation on a fixed loop, syncs layout nodes, and renders shards.

## Signature

```kotlin
@Composable
fun PhysicsScene(
  modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
  state: PhysicsSceneState = rememberPhysicsSceneState(),
  onEvent: (PhysicsSceneEvent) -> Unit = {},
  content: @Composable () -> Unit,
)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `modifier` | `Modifier` | Applies layout and visual constraints to scene root. |
| `state` | `PhysicsSceneState` | Command + snapshot state for scene control. |
| `onEvent` | `(PhysicsSceneEvent) -> Unit` | Runtime event stream callback. |
| `content` | `@Composable () -> Unit` | Compose content with bodies registered via `Modifier.physicsBody`. |

## Runtime model

1. `content` registers nodes using `Modifier.physicsBody`.
2. Node bounds and specs are synchronized into Box2D bodies.
3. A fixed-step loop advances simulation (`fixedStepHz`, `maxSubStepsPerFrame`).
4. Visual transforms are applied back to Compose nodes.
5. Shards are rendered and shard snapshots are published.

## Important behavior

- Body IDs are stable runtime keys. Reuse the same ID for the same logical item.
- Scene-local pixels are converted to Box2D meters internally using `pixelsPerMeter`.
- When a body enters `Shattering` or `Removed`, the original composable is hidden and only shards are rendered.
