`PhysicsSceneState` is your control plane for runtime commands and observability.

## Create state

```kotlin
val state = rememberPhysicsSceneState(
  pixelsPerMeter = 100f,
  gravityPxPerSecondSq = Offset(0f, 2200f),
  fixedStepHz = 60,
  maxSubStepsPerFrame = 5,
)
```

## Command API

| Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `activateBody(id)` | Activates an idle body into dynamic simulation. |
| `explode(id)` | Starts shattering (or removal fallback if shards unavailable). |
| `remove(id)` | Removes body and owned shards. |
| `respawnBody(id)` | Clears removed tombstone and restores `Idle`. |
| `applyLinearImpulse(id, impulsePx)` | Applies impulse vector to body center. |
| `pulseFromBody(originId, radiusPx, impulse)` | Emits radial impulse from one body. |
| `attractShards(ownerId, targetPx, impulsePx, maxDistancePx)` | Pulls shards toward a point. |
| `removeShard(shardId)` | Removes one shard by runtime ID. |
| `resetScene()` | Clears all runtime state and snapshots. |

## Snapshot API

| Property/Method | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bodySnapshots` | `StateFlow<Map<PhysicsId, PhysicsBodySnapshot>>` | Live body transforms keyed by ID. |
| `shardSnapshots` | `StateFlow<List<PhysicsShardSnapshot>>` | Live shard list. |
| `bodySnapshot(id)` | `PhysicsBodySnapshot?` | Pull latest body snapshot for one ID. |
| `shardSnapshots(ownerId = ...)` | `List<PhysicsShardSnapshot>` | Optional filter by owner ID. |

## Reset vs Respawn

- Use `resetScene()` for a global hard reset.
- Use `respawnBody(id)` for per-item recovery without dropping whole scene runtime state.
