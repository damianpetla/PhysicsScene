`CustomEffect` is a functional adapter over `PhysicsEffect`.

## Signature

```kotlin
fun interface CustomEffect : PhysicsEffect {
  override fun bodySpec(baseSpec: PhysicsBodySpec): PhysicsBodySpec
}
```

## Why use it

Use `CustomEffect` when built-ins are close but you need precise low-level overrides.

## Example

```kotlin
private val RecallEffect: CustomEffect = run {
  val base = CenterBurstEffect(
    shardsRows = 4,
    shardsCols = 8,
    impulseMin = 0.12f,
    impulseMax = 0.28f,
  )

  CustomEffect { input ->
    val spec = base.bodySpec(input)
    spec.copy(
      friction = 0.52f,
      restitution = 0.08f,
      linearDamping = 0.22f,
      angularDamping = 0.24f,
      explosionSpec = spec.explosionSpec.copy(
        shardColliderShape = ShardColliderShape.Box,
        shardTtlMs = -1,
      ),
    )
  }
}
```

This pattern is used in the shard recall demo to keep shards alive and controllable for reassembly.
