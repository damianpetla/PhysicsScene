PhysicsScene exposes high-level effects via `PhysicsEffect`, each building a `PhysicsBodySpec`.

## Built-ins

| Effect | Trigger model | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FallingShatterEffect` | Impact-triggered | Falling cards/buttons that break on first hit. |
| `CenterBurstEffect` | Explicit `explode(id)` | Controlled burst interactions, often with zero gravity. |
| `CustomEffect` | Your rule | Fully custom behavior using `baseSpec` transformation. |

## Selection guide

- Choose `FallingShatterEffect` for simple “drop and break”.
- Choose `CenterBurstEffect` for explicit tap-triggered bursts.
- Choose `CustomEffect` when defaults are close but not enough.
