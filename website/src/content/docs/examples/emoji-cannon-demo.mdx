## What this demo shows

- Dynamic projectile spawning with per-shot body IDs.
- Manual impulse control for launch trajectories.
- Impact-triggered shatter scoped to world bounds collisions.

## Key APIs

- `PhysicsBodySpec(bodyType = Dynamic, ...)`
- `applyLinearImpulse(id, impulsePx)`
- `explodeOnImpactByIds = setOf(PhysicsCollisionIds.WORLD_BOUNDS)`
- `remove(id)` and `resetScene()` for cleanup
